Data Science  Project
This repository contains various data science  projects that cover a range of tasks, including classification, regression, and prediction. The goal of these projects is to demonstrate the practical application of  algorithms and techniques. Below are the descriptions of each task and their respective datasets.

1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about individual passengers on the Titanic, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. The task is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

Steps
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)

Feature selection and engineering

Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score



2. Movie Rating Prediction
Description
This project involves building a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features such as genre, director, and actors. The goal is to predict the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

Steps
Data exploration and preprocessing

Feature engineering (e.g., converting categorical features to numerical)

Model training using regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.


3. Iris Flower Classification
Description
The Iris dataset contains information about three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal is to classify the flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Steps
Data preprocessing (handling missing values and scaling features)

Feature selection and engineering

Train a classification model (e.g., KNN, Decision Trees)

Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score




4. Sales Prediction Using Python
Description
Sales prediction involves forecasting future sales based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, customer demographics, and marketing strategies. The goal of this project is to predict the future sales for a given business using machine learning algorithms.

Steps
Data preprocessing (handling missing values and feature scaling)

Feature engineering (e.g., creating new features from the existing ones)

Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor)

Evaluate the model using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.




5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Description
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transaction data, and the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

Steps
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalizing data, handling class imbalance)

Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluate the model using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Use techniques like oversampling or undersampling to handle class imbalance.



Requirements
To run the projects, you'll need the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib

seaborn

xgboost (for fraud detection)
